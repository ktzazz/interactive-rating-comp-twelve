## My process

This time I was able to work way more fast on the html and css, but for the script I got kind of stucked, even though I already had in mind what I wanted and needed to do. 
The fact that I still keep on forgetting the methods make me to really slow down, but i'm pretty sure that all can come together with lots of practice. I'm happy with today's results :D
